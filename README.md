# 42 Push Swap Project

The **Push Swap** project is a sorting algorithm challenge where the goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. You are given two stacks, **A** and **B**, and must manipulate them using commands like `push`, `swap`, `rotate`, and `reverse rotate` to sort the numbers in ascending order on stack **A**.

This project focuses on understanding algorithms, optimization, and efficient problem-solving. You'll need to design a strategy to sort the stack with the fewest possible operations, especially for larger datasets.

By completing this project, you'll gain a deeper understanding of algorithm design, data structures, and how to approach complex problems with creative solutions.
